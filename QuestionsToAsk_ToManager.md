# Manager Alignment & Performance Planning

This document is a structured guide for aligning with your manager and key stakeholders. It is designed to help you understand business priorities, define your role clearly, and set meaningful performance and development goals for the year.

The goal is to ensure that your work, learning, and growth are directly connected to what the organization and your team actually need.

## 1. Questions to Ask in 1:1 Meetings with Your Manager

Use your one-on-one meetings to gain clarity on expectations, priorities, and success criteria.

Ask the following:

- What are the functional or line-of-business priorities for this year?
- What should my biggest priorities be in my first 90 days?
- What would be considered a “quick win” for my role to gain credibility and help the business?
- What are the norms and expectations for communication on this team?

## 2. Meet & Greet with Key Stakeholders

Work with your manager to schedule introductory meetings with important stakeholders across the business.

During those conversations, ask:

- What are your top priorities this year?
- How can I best support you in meeting those objectives?
- What opportunities do you see for my role or department?

These conversations help you understand how your work fits into the larger picture and where you can create the most value.

## 3. Creating Performance & Development Goals

Work with your manager to define your performance goals for the year. You should aim to create:

- **1–2 Development Goals** (focused on learning and growth)  
- **2–3 Contribution Goals** (focused on impact and results)

Your goals should be built around the following four essential questions:

- What impact can I make on my team’s objectives and key results?
- What are the measures of success for my individual role?
- Where is the company headed, and what do I want from my career?
- How can I grow my skills and behaviors to prepare for that future?

Once these questions are clearly answered and your goals are defined with your manager, this process can be considered complete for the year.
