## 1. What Is a Review Paper?

A **review research paper**:
- Summarizes and analyzes existing research
- Identifies trends, strengths, and gaps
- Compares methodologies and results
- Does **not** claim novelty in experiments or theory

Review papers are especially suitable for:
- Undergraduate and BE/BTech projects
- Early-stage research exploration
- Technology surveys

---

## 2. Tools Used

### AI Tools
- **ChatGPT (Normal Mode)**  
  Used for understanding, summarizing, writing, paraphrasing, and structuring content.
  
- **ChatGPT Deep Research Mode**  
  Used strictly for discovering and listing relevant research papers with citations.

### Academic Tools
- Google Scholar
- IEEE Xplore
- ScienceDirect
- Overleaf (LaTeX)
- BibTeX for references

(Optional)
- NotebookLM for multi-paper analysis

---

## 3. Overall Workflow

Guidelines → Background → Outline → Paper Search → Notes → Writing → Polishing → Submission

AI is used **at every stage**, but in **different modes**.

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Guide

---

### Step 1: Understand Requirements & Constraints

**Goal:** Identify formatting rules, mandatory sections, citation style, and submission constraints.

**Inputs:**
- Journal / conference template
- University guidelines
- Project coordinator instructions

**ChatGPT Mode:** Normal Chat

**Typical Prompts:**
- “Extract mandatory formatting rules and section requirements.”
- “Summarize citation and plagiarism constraints.”

---

### Step 2: Build Background Context

**Goal:** Ensure continuity with existing work (projects, coursework, reports).

**Inputs:**
- Previous semester reports
- Project PPTs
- Proposal documents

**ChatGPT Mode:** Normal Chat (with file uploads)

**Output:**
- Technical summary
- Identification of review angles aligned with prior work

---

### Step 3: Finalize Paper Structure

**Goal:** Lock the review paper outline before literature search.

**Typical Sections:**
- Introduction
- Fundamentals / Background
- Classification of Techniques
- Comparative Analysis
- Applications
- Challenges & Limitations
- Future Research Directions
- Conclusion

**ChatGPT Mode:** Normal Chat

**Important Rule:**  
Do **not** start searching papers before finalizing the outline.

---

### Step 4: Literature Discovery (Deep Research)

**Goal:** Find high-quality, recent, and relevant research papers.

**ChatGPT Mode:** Deep Research

**Guidelines:**
- Limit to recent papers (e.g., last 10 years)
- Prefer highly cited or reputable venues
- Categorize papers by sub-topic

**Outputs:**
- Paper title
- Authors
- Year
- Venue
- Short abstract-level summary

**Note:**  
AI should help *discover* papers, not download full PDFs.

---

### Step 5: Organize & Categorize Papers

**Goal:** Convert raw papers into structured knowledge.

**Actions:**
- Group papers by technique or theme
- Create summary tables
- Write bullet-point notes per paper

**ChatGPT Mode:** Normal Chat

---

### Step 6: Synthesize Literature (Core Review Work)

**Goal:** Identify patterns, similarities, differences, and gaps.

**Tasks:**
- Compare methodologies
- Contrast performance metrics
- Identify commonly reported limitations

**ChatGPT Mode:** Normal Chat

**Example Outputs:**
- Comparative paragraphs
- Advantage/disadvantage lists
- Trend observations

---

### Step 7: Write the Paper Section-by-Section

**Goal:** Convert analysis into formal academic writing.

**Best Practices:**
- Write one section at a time
- Use LaTeX (IEEE/Springer templates)
- Avoid over-polished language

**ChatGPT Mode:** Normal Chat

**Example Prompt:**
> “Write Section 3.2 in IEEE LaTeX format using neutral academic tone and proper citations.”

---

### Step 8: Citations & Reference Management

**Goal:** Maintain clean and consistent references.

**Tools:**
- BibTeX
- DOI-based citation entries

**Rules:**
- Never copy references blindly
- Verify each citation manually
- Use consistent citation style

---

### Step 9: Polishing & Humanization

**Goal:** Reduce AI-detectable patterns and improve readability.

**Tasks:**
- Rewrite in student academic tone
- Add transition sentences
- Insert personal analytical observations

**ChatGPT Mode:** Normal Chat

**Example Prompts:**
- “Rewrite this to sound like a BE review paper.”
- “Reduce repetitive academic phrasing.”

---

### Step 10: Final Review & Defense Preparation

**Goal:** Ensure you can explain and defend the paper.

**Tasks:**
- Generate viva questions
- Prepare justifications for paper selection
- Identify future work directions

**ChatGPT Mode:** Normal Chat

---

## 5. Ethical Use of AI

Acceptable:
- Literature organization
- Summarization
- Language refinement
- Structural guidance

Not acceptable:
- Copying paper text verbatim
- Claiming AI-generated insights as experimental results
- Fabricating citations

**Suggested Disclosure Statement:**
> “AI tools were used for literature organization and language refinement.”

---

## 6. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Writing the full paper in one AI prompt
- Using Deep Research mode for writing
- Ignoring formatting guidelines
- Overly generic or flawless language
- Not understanding cited papers

---

## 7. Final Checklist

- [ ] Guidelines followed
- [ ] Outline finalized before research
- [ ] Papers categorized logically
- [ ] All citations verified
- [ ] AI language humanized
- [ ] Ready for viva defense

---

## Conclusion

When used correctly, ChatGPT and Deep Research act as **powerful research assistants**, enabling faster literature review, better organization, and clearer writing, while keeping academic integrity intact.
