# Learnings

This repository is a personal knowledge base where I document everything that helps me grow as an engineer and a technologist.

It is not meant to be a tutorial repository, it is a **thinking, learning, and reflection space**.  
Everything here represents what I have learned, built, struggled with, and understood along the way.

## What you will find here

This repository will contain:

- Notes from technical videos, courses, and talks  
- Career insights from experienced engineers  
- QA, automation, performance testing, and DevOps learnings  
- Reflections on mistakes, failures, and breakthroughs

## How this repository is used

I treat this repository as:
- A second brain  
- A career journal  
- A technical knowledge vault  

Anything that feels **“this could matter in 2–5 years”** goes here.

## Who this is for

Primarily, this repository is for **me**.

But if someone else finds value in it,
whether you are a student, tester, or developer,  
you are welcome to learn from it.
